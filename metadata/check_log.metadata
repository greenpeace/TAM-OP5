Checks log files on unix system.
[why]

[how]
This plugin will scan a log file (specified by the <log_file> option) for a specific pattern (specified by the <pattern> option).  Successive calls to the plugin script will only report *new* pattern matches in the log file, since an copy of the log file from the previous run is saved to <old_log_file>.
