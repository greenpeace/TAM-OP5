check_snmp_win

[info]
The plugin is used to monitor windows servers over SNMP instead of using any agent.

[why]
Sometimes you are unable to install an agent on the monitored windows server. Setting up all SNMP services by hand is a hard work. Then you have this plugin that already made the job for you.

[how]
The monitored data is checked over SNMP.
