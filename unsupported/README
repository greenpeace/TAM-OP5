The plugins in the /opt/plugins/unsupported and below are packaged
as an addition to the plugins package in the hope that it will be useful,
but OP5 has not verified, tested or otherwise qualified the plugins
residing in this directory or any directory below them.

check_commands or statistics scripts pointing to scripts in the
unsupported directory may are discouraged unless you really know what
you're doing, since those check_commands may no longer work in the future
should we decide to start to support the plugin in question, in which case
we will move the supported plugin to the standard plugin directory,
/opt/plugins.
